# movies_sql_final_project
Final project looking at movie earnings and ratings across audience demographics.
What trends or patterns did you observe?
I noticed quite a lot of movies were in Drama, Adventure, Action, and Comedy genres, with a fair number of other films having their genre be missing which could indicate uncertainty in how a movie's genre should be categorized. I did observe an expected outcome with sorting for movies that my age group ("Votes3044M" meaning "votes from males between the ages of 30-44") liked a lot of the same movies as I do, such as "Inception", "The Dark Knight Rises", "Interstellar", and "Django Unchained" being the top 4.

Were there any unexpected findings?
I was quite surprised to find that "Tucker and Dale vs Evil" had such low Domestic earnings due to how much I've heard my peers praise the film's comedic beats. It earned less than a quarter-million domestically, but saw a much higher earning globally with over 4.5 million!

How do the insights relate to the original questions you had about the dataset?
I was originally curious how close to my own tastes the people of my age group compares against the world. It was pleasing to see some of my personal favorites match up with the movies near the top, while surprising to see some of my other favorites rate so low. It just goes to show that everyone has differing tastes, which makes the world that much more interesting in its variety of favorites.
